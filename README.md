# Advanced TensorFlow Techniques

Welcome to the **Advanced TensorFlow Techniques** repository. This collection of Jupyter notebooks is designed to provide comprehensive demonstrations of advanced methodologies within the TensorFlow framework. It serves as a valuable resource for those looking to deepen their understanding and proficiency in TensorFlow's capabilities.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized to cover a range of advanced TensorFlow techniques, including but not limited to:

- **Building Custom Models**: Learn how to construct models tailored to specific needs using TensorFlow's powerful features.
- **Creating Custom Layers**: Explore how to design and implement custom layers to enhance model performance and flexibility.
- **Developing Custom Loss Functions**: Understand the process of crafting loss functions that cater to unique requirements of different machine learning tasks.
- **Utilizing Functional APIs**: Discover the versatility and power of TensorFlow's functional APIs for model building.
- **Exploring Differentiation and Gradient Computation**: Delve into the mechanisms of automatic differentiation and gradient computation to optimize model training.
- **Implementing Custom Training Routines**: Gain insights into designing and executing custom training loops for more control over the training process.
- **Techniques in Distributed Training**: Learn about strategies and tools for training models in distributed environments to improve scalability and efficiency.
- **Utilizing Graph Mode for Computations**: Understand how to leverage TensorFlow's graph mode to optimize computational performance and resource utilization.

## Note

Due to a loss of data from my previous repository, this repository is result restoration process and therefore is still Work in Progress.

I hope you find these resources useful in your advanced TensorFlow endeavors. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome.
