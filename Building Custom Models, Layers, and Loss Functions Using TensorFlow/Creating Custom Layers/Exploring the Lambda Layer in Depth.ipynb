This versatile layer allows for the integration of simple functions into the model architecture, enhancing its flexibility without the need for creating fully custom layers. We have two options for using the Lambda layer:\n","\n","1. Lambda Functions: Directly insert lambda functions, which are small anonymous functions in Python, right into the Lambda layer. This method is quick and convenient for simple operations.\n","2. Custom Functions: Alternatively, we can define a more complex custom function and then pass it to the Lambda layer.
