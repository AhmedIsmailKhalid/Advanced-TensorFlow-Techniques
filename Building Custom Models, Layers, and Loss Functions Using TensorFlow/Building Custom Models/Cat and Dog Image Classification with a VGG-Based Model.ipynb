This flexibility is crucial when we need to dynamically access or modify attributes based on their names, which might not be predetermined in our code.\n","2. **Handling Sequential Variables:** Consider a situation where our object needs to handle a sequence of similarly named variables like var4, var5, ..., var9. Using `vars()` allows we to easily generate or access these variables in a loop, where the variable's name can be constructed as a string dynamically. This is much more convenient than manually coding each variable individually, especially as the number of variables grows.\n","3. **Scalable and Flexible Code:** This method makes our code more scalable and adaptable to changes. For example, if we decide to add more variables or change the naming convention, we can easily adjust the loop or the string manipulation logic without needing to overhaul the codebase.\n","\n","This approach can significantly simplify the process of managing multiple variables, making our code cleaner and more maintainable, particularly in applications requiring extensive data manipulation or configuration."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"X7LOrM9HpOYD","outputId":"1978b843-0248-4e37-ab68-8f5142efd3b3"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["{'var1': 1,\n"," 'var2': 2,\n"," 'var3': 3,\n"," 'var4': 0,\n"," 'var5': 0,\n"," 'var6': 0,\n"," 'var7': 0,\n"," 'var8': 0,\n"," 'var9': 0}"]},"execution_count":7,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Use a for loop to increment the index 'i'\n","for i in range(4,10):\n","    # Format a string that is var\n","    vars(my_obj)[f'var{i}'] = 0\n","\n","# View the object's instance variables!\n","vars(my_obj)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dRzPS4ZzpOYE"},"source":["In Python, formatting strings can be accomplished in several efficient ways, each providing its own advantages depending on the context and Python version. Here are two common methods:\n","\n","- **F-strings:** Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings offer a very readable, concise, and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. The syntax involves prefixing the string with an f or F. For example, if we want to dynamically generate string names in a loop, we can use f\"var{i}\", where i is the loop variable. This method is both fast and easy to read, making it a popular choice for Python developers.\n","- **format method:** This method has been available since Python 2.6 and is useful across a wider range of Python versions, including those not supporting f-strings. The format method involves writing placeholder braces {} within the string and then calling `.format()` with the values or variables that should replace these placeholders. For example, `\"var{}\".format(i)` achieves the same outcome as the f-string method but is slightly more verbose.\n","\n","Both methods are highly effective for creating formatted strings and can be chosen based on the specific requirements of the codebase or personal preference for syntax style."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZjR1dkjApOYF","outputId":"8fb7cb6a-140c-4203-eaeb-d7963a571053"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["var1\n","var2\n"]}],"source":["# Format a string using f-string notation\n","i=1\n","print(f\"var{i}\")\n","\n","# Format a string using .format notation\n","i=2\n","print(\"var{}\".format(i))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Bb0pFPslpOYF"},"source":["Variables of class can also be acccessed inside the class definition using `vars(self)`"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"dfdsKWeIpOYF","outputId":"54000bd6-12dc-4473-8a8c-4d418e6e52c5"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["{'var1': 1}"]},"execution_count":9,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Define a small class MyClass\n","class MyClass:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        # Use vars(self) to access the class's dictionary of variables\n","        vars(self)['var1'] = 1\n","\n","# Create an object of type MyClass()\n","my_obj = MyClass()\n","vars(my_obj)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k1T1UMw5YAkp"},"source":["## Create a generic VGG block\n","\n","Now we're going to dive into how we can modularize the construction of a VGG network by defining a Block class, capable of generating customizable blocks of Conv2D layers followed by a MaxPool2D layer.
